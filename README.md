# adjust_DRX
This is a final project of National Taiwan University class "Introduction to Wireless and Mobile Networking". 

In this project, we implement the paper "Performance Analysis of Power Saving Mechanism with Adjustable DRX Cycles in 3GPP LTE ".

This is the basic structure of the adjust DRX mechanism.

To run the simulation code, please execute the function "main" which needs four input parameters: DRX Short Cycle ( DS_t ), DRX Long Cycle ( DL_t ), DRX Inactivity Timer ( I_t ) and DRX Short Cycle Timer ( N_t ).
